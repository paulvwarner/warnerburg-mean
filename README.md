# Warnerburg MEAN

This is a no-longer-used MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node) implementation of my comics and art website, www.warnerburg.com. This version of the website showed my comic pages and drawings to the public and included an admin that allowed me to add new drawings and comic pages. The admin's most complicated feature allowed me to rearrange comic pages with a drag and drop interface.

I built this in late 2014 to learn the MEAN stack. It worked well at the time, but I wouldn't use Angular 1 today. Ultimately I switched to using Wordpress for this website instead of MEAN (which was less cutting-edge but way more full-featured, stable, and suited for this kind of website).

This uses npm to manage backend dependencies and Bower to manage frontend dependencies.  It would require a lot of work and digging up of image backups to get this back up and running locally today, and I like my website's current setup better, so I didn't include installation instructions.
